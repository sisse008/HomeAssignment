This is a runtime instruction builder that is suitable for non programmers!

To adjust the time length of a command use the time slider:

To reset the values of a command editor (will not affect time sliders) press the reset button:

To create a new command click the green plus button next to the command name


This will do two things:
Create a new instruction
Add the created command to the instruction

The instruction progress can then be seen at the top part of the screen:


The icon to the right of the buttons is to indicate that a color command has been added to the instruction. Adding more commands will add more icons.
Pressing “delete instruction progress” will delete the new instruction.
Pressing “create new instruction” will save the new instruction in memory and create a button to select it:



The X button is to delete an existing instruction and it’s button.
Instruction buttons will be on the right side of the view and are a sort of a toggle group. To execute an instruction, select an instruction (newest instruction is automatically selected) and click a robot.

An instruction can have up to 20 commands and there can be up to ten commands available for selection at any one time.

That's it! Hope you like it :) full disclosure; it took me nine hours to develop this.
